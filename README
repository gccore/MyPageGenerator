How To Build?
=============

  Depedencies:

    - CXX Standard: The code is based on C++11, but because of the stupid
                    NodeEditor library, i had to change it to C++14.
    - CMake 3.10

  Third Parities:

    - MD4C-Html
    - NodeEditor
    - Qt 5.15.2
    - tl::optional


  Open the project with QtCreator and build it, i don't care about
  those fancy things with your terminal/editor/IDE.
